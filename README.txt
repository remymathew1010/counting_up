This program was written in Java and runs as any other code from
the terminal. 

This program takes two integers and returns the C(n,k).

The only imported module used in this program is the Scanner, which is used
to take in user input (n and k).

The algorithm to solve the nCk problem was found here and changed to account
for overflow effectively:
